    "### Task 1: Archiving Virtual Artifacts - Preserving a Digital Museum\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.0.1. Task Description\n",
    "Imagine you are a data archivist working to preserve artifacts from the **Smithsonian Institution's digital collection**. Your job is to download, store, and manage different types of data (such as images, videos, and documents) to ensure they can be accessed later without repeated downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the [Smithsonian Institution Collections](https://www.si.edu/snapshot) as your source of artifacts. You are tasked with building a caching system that can store downloaded files in a structured way and retrieve them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "1. `fetch_artifact()`: Download content from the Smithsonian's collection page based on a provided URL. The method should return `True` if successful, or `False` if the download fails.\n",
    "2. `store_artifact()`: Save the content of the artifact (text, image, etc.) in a local file system. Each artifact must be stored in its own unique file based on its URL.\n",
    "3. `retrieve_artifact()`: Load an artifact from your local storage using its URL to ensure that content is cached correctly and avoid redundant downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Criteria for Success:\n",
    "- Different URLs must map to different files, even if they belong to the same domain.\n",
    "- Binary files (e.g., images) must be handled correctly without corruption.\n",
    "- Artifacts that are already stored locally should not be downloaded again.\n",

    "2. Crawls through snapshot pages, extracting key information (links, images, and text) from each page.\n",
    "3. Follows links from the initial page to other snapshot articles up to a specified depth.\n",
    "4. Processes and stores the content from each crawled page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Implement a Crawler**: Start crawling from the [Smithsonian Snapshots Page](https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/snapshots), gather links to snapshot articles, and visit each article.\n",

    "   - Anchor tags (`'link_text', 'absolute_url'`).\n",
    "   - Image URLs (absolute URLs).\n",
